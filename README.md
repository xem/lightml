lightml
=======

HTML is heavy. Send lightml instead!

Lightml files can be generated with a simple PHP script called on top of your pages.

Lightml files are regular HTML files containing

    <!doctype html>
    <script src='lightml.js'></script>

followed by lightml code.

lightml.js seamlessly converts the Lightml code in HTML.
